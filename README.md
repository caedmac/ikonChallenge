# ikonChallenge
For testing we can use the challenge.in file that is provided in the **_Test/Resources_** folder, and made the change in the **fileActionsChallenge.php** in the _$readFile_ and _$writeFile_ vars, otherwise we can use the **_Resources_** folder for run the exercise and made the updates in the mentioned vars.

We split the functionality in different files, each file has an specific propouse, this helps to isolate code and call it when is neccesary.
